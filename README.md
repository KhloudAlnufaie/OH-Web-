# 1.Introduction
An office hour application offers students to schedule an appointment with their teachers to discuss unclear points for them, discuss the exam results, or ask for guidance. In addition, it provides students with important information about their teachers, such as office numbers, email addresses, and schedules.

## 1.1	Problem Definition
Students sometimes have difficulty reaching a faculty member's information, such as their office number, schedule, and email, which may not be updated. Also, there is a problem when the teacher is available during office hours, but sometimes no student attends. Additionally, if many students are around a teacher's office, it may be uncomfortable for both parties.

## 1.2 Aims 
•	The students find all the important information about their teacher in one place.
•	Informing the teacher about the reservation of the student during office hours, which makes him present in his office.
•	Organizing and facilitating communication between the teacher and the student.


## 1.3 Objectives
•	Display the teacher's name, office number, official email, and schedule in one page.
•	Inform the teacher of the student's attendance by sending a notification after the student has made an appointment.
•	Through the application, students will be able to schedule appointments with their teachers in order to facilitate communication.
•	This application organizes communication between the teacher and the student by limiting the number of students that can reserve in a one-hour period.
